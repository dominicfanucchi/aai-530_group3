# Notebook viewing order for simplicity:
1. LSTM_Vehicle_Count_Prediction (Pre Feature Eng. Deep Learning)
2. SPEED-VEHICLE-PREDICTION-LSTM-CNN-TEAM3 (EDA and Post Feature Eng. Deep Learning)
3. Linear_Regression_AvgSpeed_Prediction

## Installation
To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:
```
git init
git clone https://github.com/dominicfanucchi/aai-501_group3.git
```

## Project Objective
Our objective is to outline an IoT system to allow you to analyze and predict traffic patterns for better time management, travel plans, and safety.

## About the Dataset
This dataset was comprised of data collected between 2014 Feb - June. There were 490 files from sensor pairs placed all over Denmark. We renamed the sensors to junctions.

These algorithms and networks were implemented through Python and Jupyter Notebooks. 

 - ### Imports and Libraries
   * Numpy 
   * Pandas 
   * Matplotlib / Pyplot
   * Scipy Stats
   * Seaborn 
   * Tensorflow
   * Keras
   * Sklearn

## Models
LSTM, GRU, CNN, and Linear Regression.

## Results
Our models showed a decent ability to forecast future traffic congestion levels and speeds. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of model accuracy and performance.
